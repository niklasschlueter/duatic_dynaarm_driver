# DynaArm Status Controller

Controller that provides additional status information about the configured DynaArm.
The published [ArmState](https://github.com/Duatic/duatic_dynaarm_driver/blob/main/dynaarm_msgs/msg/ArmState.msg) consists of an array of information about each configured [actuator](https://github.com/Duatic/duatic_dynaarm_driver/blob/main/dynaarm_msgs/msg/DriveState.msg)

## Parameters

### Definition:
```{literalinclude} ../../duatic_dynaarm_controllers/src/dynaarm_status_broadcaster_parameters.yaml
```

__joints__ | [Required]:\
List of managed joints by the controller. Always needs to be a list of all joints of an arm in the order specified in the urdf

__arm_name__ | [Required]:\
Name of the arm as specified in the ros2control part of the urdf. Currently this is `${tf_prefix}DynaarmSystem`


### Example:

A full example can be found in the [dynaarm_demo](https://github.com/Duatic/dynaarm_demo/blob/main/dynaarm_examples/config/controllers.yaml) repository.

```yaml
dynaarm_status_broadcaster:
  ros__parameters:
    joints:
      - shoulder_rotation
      - shoulder_flexion
      - elbow_flexion
      - forearm_rotation
      - wrist_flexion
      - wrist_rotation
    arm_name: DynaarmSystem
```

## ROS Interfacing

### Topics:

__~/state__ | [Publisher]:\
type: [<dynaarm_msgs/msg/ArmState>](https://github.com/Duatic/duatic_dynaarm_driver/blob/main/dynaarm_msgs/msg/ArmState.msg)
Publishes the ArmState message with the configured controller update rate.

## Additional Information

The `DriveState` message contains not only the currently read position/velocity/effort information but also the position/velocity/effort commands that where actually command and confirmed by the drive. For certain advanced control scenarios this can be advantageous. The temperature information for each phase is only provided in case the drive was configured to use the `E-type PDO`.
